# 'Articuno' - social media app for artists

Hi y'all, I set up this repo for us to work on our group project.
The repo has two directories in it: `front-end` and `back-end`. Please work within the correct directory.

## Important stuff!

We are using yarn for this project.
To set up the project:

- Clone this repo
- `cd articuno`
- `yarn install`

More notes:

- Both repos have `yarn dev` scripts - _RUN THEM INDIVIDUALLY_
  - Front end: `cd front-end` then `yarn dev`
  - Back end: `cd back-end` then `yarn dev`
- Front end runs on port 5173 by default
- Back end runs on a port you set in .env _OR_ 2501
- If you need to `yarn add` packages, do so in the proper directory.

Pre-installed dependencies:

- Back-end: Express, Nodemon, CORS
- Front-end: React, Vite, ChakraUI, react-icons

## More stuff

Please structure your code properly (folder structure).  
Remember what Zohar told us about conflicts.  
When in doubt, _message in our group on Slack_.  
Communication is key!

## Remember

- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git pull`
- `git push`

_WE ARE AWESOME, WE'VE GOT THIS, GO TEAM!_
